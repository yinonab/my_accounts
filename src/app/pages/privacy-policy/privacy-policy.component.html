    <h1>Developer Policies</h1>
    <p>
        To maintain a high standard of quality and integrity across our platform, we expect developers to adhere to the

        experiences remain positive and secure while fostering responsible and ethical development practices.

        <li>Managing applications using inauthentic or fake accounts, including bots and unauthorized automation tools.
        </li>
        <li>Engaging in activities that violate user privacy or exploit platform vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Transparency and Ad-Buying Solutions</h2>

            and disclosures.</li>
        <li>Adhering to ethical practices in ad management, including avoiding misleading or deceptive content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. App Development Guidelines</h2>
    <p>To support the creation of high-quality applications, we provide the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Controls</strong>: Implement thorough testing to prevent bugs, crashes, and performance
            issues.</li>
        <li><strong>User Experience</strong>: Prioritize intuitive navigation, accessibility, and seamless
            functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Requirements</strong>: Ensure all content aligns with community guidelines and does not
            promote harmful, offensive, or misleading material.</li>
        <li><strong>Functional Standards</strong>: Avoid excessive permissions requests and provide clear explanations
            for required permissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Policy Updates and Readability</h2>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
